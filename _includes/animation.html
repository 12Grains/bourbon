  <h2>Animations</h2>
  <p>The animation mixins support comma separated lists of values, which allows different transitions for individual properties to be described in a single style rule. Each value in the list corresponds to the value at that same position in the other properties.</p>

  <h3>Demo Code</h3>
{% highlight scss %}
box:hover {
  @include animation-name(slideup, fadein);
  @include animation-duration(1.0s, 1.2s);
  @include animation-timing-function(ease-in-out, ease-out);

  // Animation shorthand works the same as the CSS3 animation shorthand
  @include animation(slideup fadein, 1.0s 2.0s, ease-in);
}

@mixin scale {
  0%   { @include transform(scale(1.0)); }
  50%  { @include transform(scale(2.0)); }
  100% { @include transform(scale(1.0)); }
}
@-webkit-keyframes scale { @include scale; }
